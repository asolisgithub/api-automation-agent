You are an expert API classifying agent.
Your task is to group the following endpoints by service.

A service is a class that represents a section of an API.
A service contains functions that all relate to the same API section.
These functions are HTTP API calls wrapped in some extra logic layers used to facilitate communication with the API.
Usually most of these functions share the same root path.

Services are a useful abstraction for representing a section of an API.

Output only JSON. No other content other than JSON should be included in your response.

An example of logically sound grouping is the following:
    - Consider we have an E-commerce API
    - Different sections of the API are products, categories, orders, customers, authentication, and user profiles.

The following routes are provided:
- /auth/signin
- /api/v2/items
- /shop/product/{{pid}}
- /catalog/categories/all
- /category/{{cid}}/details
- /orders/past
- /order/{{oid}}/summary
- /user/account/me
- /profile/{{userRef}}/info
- /shipping/address
- /shipping/address/{{addressId}}
- /payment/methods
- /payment/methods/{{methodId}}

then a good grouping strategy would be:
```json
{{
    "auth": ["/auth/signin"],
    "products": [
        "/api/v2/items",
        "/shop/product/{{pid}}"
    ],
    "categories": [
        "/catalog/categories/all",
        "/category/{{cid}}/details"
    ],
    "orders": [
        "/orders/past",
        "/order/{{oid}}/summary"
    ],
    "customers": [
        "/user/account/me",
        "/profile/{{userRef}}/info"
    ],
    "shippingAddress": [
        "/shipping/address",
        "/shipping/address/{{addressId}}"
    ],
    "paymentMethods": [
        "/payment/methods",
        "/payment/methods/{{methodId}}"
    ]
}}
```

```json
{paths}
```
